I started with the full-time Web intensive class and I am now in the middle of taking an iOS class. What separates FS360 is that I learn only very relevant technologies that will be useful in the near future.  When you stumble down the rabbit hole, the instructor guides you but does not hold your hand.

If you want to work for a leading tech firm, for a technology startup, or become an entrepreneur, this 2-week class will put you on the right track to achieve any of these goals.  This iOS class is based entirely on Swift language, which is the main language you will need to know while developing the majority of iOS app.  In our iOS class you will not be learning how to program games, however you will be able to learn how to develop social media applications similar to Snapchat and Instagram.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEven if you do not want to become a professional developer and have it become your lifelong career, learning how an iOS app developed will give you the edge both in the immediate and distant future.  It might be a cliché, but learning how to code will empower you to act on future ideas.  For example if you are sitting in class one day and think of the next great social media app, it doesn’t have to just be a pipe dream or something that you would have to rely on someone else to build, it could be a project that you start building right away.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FullStack-360-1631852427085987/\" className=\"social-icon inline-block si-small si-light si-rounded si-facebook\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i className=\"icon-facebook\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i className=\"icon-facebook\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/fullstack360\" className=\"social-icon inline-block si-small si-light si-rounded si-twitter\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i className=\"icon-twitter\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i className=\"icon-twitter\"></i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"col-sm-4 col-padding\" style={{background: \"url('/images/kids.jpg') center center no-repeat\", backgroundSize: 'cover'}}></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"content-wrap\" style={{background:'#f9f9f9', borderBottom:'1px solid #ddd'}}>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"container clear-bottommargin clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"row\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"col-md-4 col-sm-6 bottommargin\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"ipost clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"entry-image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img style={{background:'#fff', padding:6, border:'1px solid #ddd'}} className=\"image_fade\" src=\"/images/class.jpg\" alt=\"FullStack 360\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"entry-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Small Classes</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<hr />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOur average class size is six students and the maximum per class is ten.
