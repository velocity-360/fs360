			Hello,
			<p>
				Considering all the options for tech bootcamps, what is the best stack to learn in 2016? 
				Answer: React with Node JS. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The data supports React with Node. StackOverflow's <a href=" http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016">2016 Developer Survey</a> declared React the #1 Top Trending Tech (up 311% this year alone!), while Ruby is fading from interest (down 6.6%). React is among the 10 Top Paying Technologies list, not Ruby on Rails. Front-end Developers who know React make an average of $35,000 more than those who know Ruby.

			</p>

				<i>"<strong>
					Full-Stack Developers who know JavaScript and develop for the Cloud, or work with React or Redis are paid better than their peers.
				</strong>"</i>
				<br /><br />

			<p>
				We wrote a blog post, <a href="https://www.velocity360.io/post/starting-out-today">Starting Out Today</a>, which further examines the job market and reasons for choosing React &amp; Node JS. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In NYC alone, there are many Ruby on Rails bootcamps (General Assembly, Flatiron School, DevBootcamp, NYCDA, App Academy, etc.) that churn out hundreds of junior devs every few months. Why compete in an over-saturated market for entry level jobs? 
			</p>

			<p>
				The <a href="https://www.velocity360.io/course/8-week-fundamentals-bootcamp">8-Week Fundamentals Bootcamp</a> covers backend and frontend development using the most up-to-date technologies. Designed for beginner-to-intermediate programmers, the Bootcamp teaches full-stack development for both web and mobile using Node, React and React Native.
